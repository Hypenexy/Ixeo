# Ixeo
### Search the web (small part of it) here

Attempting to be the ~fastest~ smallest loading search engine!  
I will build on top of it in updates. For now it barely works but it does.  
  
All of my different scrapers are included in the repository.  
If you wanna see my timeline of learning and laugh at stupid code check out  
the [experiments/old experiments/](https://github.com/Hypenexy/Ixeo/tree/main/experiments/older%20experiments) folder.  
  
I wanted to include my datasets and generated/downloaded images but they were 10k+ and datasets are 200mb so I couldn't.  
  
Now the 1.0.0 release of Ixeo is running on the link above with a total of ~2gib of data from scraping Wikipedia and popular websites. They were scraped using the scraper in the [WebScraper](https://github.com/Hypenexy/Ixeo/tree/main/WebScraper) folder.
